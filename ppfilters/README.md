# Post Process Filter (PPfilter)
For Assetto Corsa (2014) **OPTIONAL** Requirements:
- Latest CSP!
- Sol, preferably Pure for improve fps a bit and better looking environment (depends the colour grading)

> *NOTE.* The pure config is using skydome and if you don't have it or not using Pure. Assetto Corsa will automatically switch to the 3D Clouds

## How-to
### Copy-paste [ppfilter-name].ini
1. Make .txt file rename it to the PPfilter name
2. Copy the all the content from [ppfilter-name].ini from here to the .txt previously made
3. Paste & save it
4. Rename the extension file from .txt to .ini and if there's warning proceed it
5. Move it to the game directory

###### Directory

```
assettocorsa
|__system
   |__cfg
      |__ppfilters
```

---

### Copy-paste pure_config.ini

Overall the same as **Copy-paste [ppfilter-name].ini** but the directory is different...

###### Directory

```
assettocorsa
|__extension
   |__config-ext
      |__Pure
```
