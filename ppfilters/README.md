For Assetto Corsa (2014) Requirements:
- Latest CSP, DON'T USE THE RECOMMENDED
- Pure 0.7.5 or later. It works with Sol but I recommended to use Pure
- PLEASE SET SKY AND CLOUD to 3D Cloud because I use Skydome (for those who don't have Skydome/using Pure 0.7.5)

## How-to
**Copy-paste [ppfilter-name].ini**
1. Make .txt file rename it to the PPfilter name
2. Copy the all the content from [ppfilter-name].ini from here to the .txt previously made
3. Paste & save it
4. Rename the extension file from .txt to .ini and if there's warning proceed it
5. Move it to the game directory ...\assettocorsa\system\cfg\ppfilters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Copy-paste pure_config.ini**

Overall the same as **Copy-paste [ppfilter-name].ini** but the directory is different. ...\assettocorsa\extension\config-ext\Pure

Enjoy! :)
