For Assetto Corsa (2014) Requirements:

- Latest CSP, DON'T USE THE RECOMMENDED
- Pure 0.7.5 or later. It works with Sol but I recommended to use Pure
- PLEASE SET SKY AND CLOUD to 3D Cloud because I use Skydome (for those who don't have Skydome/using Pure 0.7.5)

|HOW TO COPY-PASTE IT:|

1. Create .txt file rename it to name you like it
2. Copy the all the lines
3. Paste
4. Save it
5. Rename the .txt to .ini and apply
6. Move it to the game directory (...\assettocorsa\system\cfg\ppfilters and ...\assettocorsa\extension\config-ext\Pure for Pure config)

Enjoy! :)
