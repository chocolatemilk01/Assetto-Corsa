# DIY Extension

1. Make a folder named "extension" inside the track's folder
2. Make .txt file, rename to "ext_config" and apply
3. Write the content you want to add, you can copy-paste from another and modify it
4. Rename the **.txt** to **.ini** and confirm

It can be simple and also complex making the extension, so... the guide also content is on here:
